　　This is an extremely simple quadruped robot simulation in [**Unity3D**](https://unity.com/products). These are some of the experiments I conducted in my early exploration of simulated robots. Note that there is no very deep algorithm here, it only has a certain reference meaning for Unity3D project construction.
